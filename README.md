# SlackStorm
PHP Storm (IntelliJ) plugin that allows posting code snippets to a Slack channel. Sharing code snippets to colleagues over IM is a pain, so I made it slightly less painful. 

Simple: Hightlight some text, hit 'Send to Slack', rejoice

#Install
- Create a incoming webhook integration for your channel
- Copy the webhook path (the part after https://hooks.slack.com/services/)
- Put it into the slack settings
- Restart
